WSADATA is a data structure in Winsock library and it is used to store information 
    about the initialization and configuration of winsock library
    WSAStartup() initializes the Winsock library, and the WSADATA structure (wsaData) is used to store information about the initialized version of Winsock. Later in your program, you would use Winsock functions for networking tasks, and finally, you would call WSACleanup() to release any resources acquired during initialization.
