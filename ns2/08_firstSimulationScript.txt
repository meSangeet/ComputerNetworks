we need to create a simulator class object

set ns [new simulator]

set tr [ open "out.txt" w]
$ns trace-all $tr 
//above line means this tr file we are going to use to save all of our simulation results

set ftr [open "out.nam" w] //in this file we will save our data for network animator 
$ns namtrace-all $ftr 

//creating nodes

set n0 [$ns node]
set n1 [$ns node]

//setting connection between these two nodes
$ns duplex -link $n0 $n1 2MB 4ms DropTail

//to generate traffic

set tcp1 [new Agent/TCP]
set sink [new Agent/TCPSink]
//tcp sink works as tcp receiver 

$ns attach-agent $n0 $tcp1 
$ns attach-agent $n1 $sink
//above we attached agent to nodes 

//establishing connection 

$ns connect $n0 $n1 

set ftp [new Application/FTP]

$ftp attach.agent $tcp1 

proc finish { } {
    global ns tr ftr 
    $ns flush-trace 
    close $ftr 
    close $tr 
    exec nam out.nam &
    exit
}
