We don't need to declare variable we can directly set the variables

set a 12
set b "this"
set c 2.3

puts $a 
// returns 12

we can also use
set x $a 

//addition  ->  expr $a + 12

set r [expr $a + 12]
whenever we use a result of command we enclose the command in the square bracket

When we use puts two times, puts, two things will automatically be printed on a new line if we want them to be printed on the same line we can use

puts -nonewline "Hello, "
puts "World!"
